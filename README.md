# Special Boots

A Fabric mod for Minecraft 1.21.11 that adds the **Heavyfoot** enchantment.

## What it does

Heavyfoot is a single-level enchantment that can only be applied to boots. While wearing enchanted boots, the player automatically:

- **Destroys flowers and bushes** (short grass, tall grass, ferns, dead bushes, sweet berry bushes, and all flowers) in a small area around their feet.
- **Converts grass blocks into dirt paths** beneath their steps.
